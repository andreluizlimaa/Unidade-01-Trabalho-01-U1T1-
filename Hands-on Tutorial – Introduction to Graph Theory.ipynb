    "# Hands-on Tutorial – Introduction to Graph Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a practical introduction to graph theory using the Python library `networkx` to build, visualize, and analyze various types of graphs. The aim is to combine theoretical concepts (based on literature in complex networks) with hands-on coding examples, so you can experiment and adapt the code to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "- Understand basic concepts of graphs: nodes, edges, simple graphs, directed graphs, and weighted graphs.\n",
    "- Explore practical examples of creating and visualizing graphs.\n",
    "- Encourage experimentation with network manipulation and basic algorithms.\n",

    "A **graph** \\(G = (V, E)\\) consists of a set of **nodes** \\(V\\) and a set of **edges** \\(E\\) that connect pairs of nodes. Depending on the nature of these connections, graphs can be categorized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple Graphs:** No self-loops and at most one edge between any pair of nodes.\n",
    "- **Directed Graphs:** Edges have a direction, meaning that connections are not necessarily reciprocal.\n",
    "- **Weighted Graphs:** Each edge has an associated numerical value (weight) representing, for example, the strength or cost of the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will create practical examples for each type."
